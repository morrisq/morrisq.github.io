    "## Introduction/Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile gaming experiences can range from a casual, non-commital, completely free experience to that of an potential monetary sinkhole that may demand you to spend hours of your time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I, personally, play several mobile games and do enjoy jumping from game to game just to see what each one is like. But sometimes, I get curious to see the app store statistics behind these titles and wonder how they rank in terms of other games as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspiration\n",
    "The main inspiration for this curiosity was this article (https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-anime-inspired-game-surpassed-fortnite-as-twitt/1100-6464600/) from Gamespot. In it, it states that Fortnite, the mobile version of the infamous battle royale game that was heavily popularized at the time, was actually talked about **less** than the mobile game Fate/Grand Order, which I was an avid player of at the time. While I'm not too completely sure about how much revenue and how big of a fanbase each game had at the time (this was from 2018), I have been curious to see how some of the Mobile Games I play stack up to other games on the market."

    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze 2019 app data from the iTunes and Google Play stores, analyzing and combining both datasets and viewing any sorts of trends that can be derived from them, in a way, establishing a tierlist of sorts between all of these games. We will also do a brief look into revenue streams for certain apps and look at the relationship between ranking, reviews and revenue. \n",

    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The iTunes mobile game dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games\n",
    "\n",
    "The Google Play Store mobile game dataset can be found here:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home?select=googleplaystore.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will also scrape data from https://thinkgaming.com/app-sales-data which covers data pertaining to iTunes mobile game sales (not android). Unfortunately, most data pertaining to mobile game sales is locked behind paywalls from sites such as \"Think Gaming\" and \"Sensor Tower\" which provide a wide variety of metrics mainly intended for corporate usage."

The API itself is limited to around 20 queries per minute and is also geared more towards music.
